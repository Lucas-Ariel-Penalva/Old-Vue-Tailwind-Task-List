# Vue Task List App

### [The deployed version can be seen here.](https://lucas-ariel-penalva.github.io/Old-Vue-Tailwind-Task-App-Build/)

This was the first full program I made back when I was starting to learn how to program. I learned a lot about Vue, CSS and animations while creating this. I now uploaded it to my github exactly as It was.


### Looking back at the code, I can see many things that I would do different now:

* Despite being a simple practice application that wasn't meant to be polished, I would still split some parts of the application into components instead of merely using the main app file.

* When working with TailwindCSS, it's often better to add all the utility classes that change the position of an element at the beginning of the class list.

* The blue background makes it so you can't easily see the focus state of the buttons, which reduces accessibility.

* There's no proper type checking or error handling in the functions. 

* I would pick different colors and font.
